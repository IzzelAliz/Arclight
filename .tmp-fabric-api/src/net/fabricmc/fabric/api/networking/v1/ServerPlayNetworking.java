/**
 * Offers access to play stage server-side networking functionalities.
 *
 * <p>Server-side networking functionalities include receiving serverbound packets, sending clientbound packets, and events related to server-side packet listeners.
 * Packets <strong>received</strong> by this class must be registered to {@link PayloadTypeRegistry#serverboundPlay()} on both ends.
 * Packets <strong>sent</strong> by this class must be registered to {@link PayloadTypeRegistry#clientboundPlay()} on both ends.
 * Packets must be registered before registering any receivers.
 *
 * <p>This class should be only used for the logical server.
 *
 * <h2>Packet object-based API</h2>
 *
 * <p>This class provides a registration method, utilizing packet objects, {@link #registerGlobalReceiver(CustomPacketPayload.Type, PlayPayloadHandler)}.
 * This handler executes the callback in the server thread, ensuring thread safety.
 *
 * <p>This payload object-based API involves three classes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A class implementing {@link CustomPacketPayload} that is "sent" over the network</li>
 *     <li>{@link CustomPacketPayload.TypeAndCodec} instance, which represents the packet's type (and its codec)</li>
 *     <li>{@link PlayPayloadHandler}, which handles the packet (usually implemented as a functional interface)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>See the documentation on each class for more information.
 *
 * @see ServerLoginNetworking
 * @see ServerConfigurationNetworking
